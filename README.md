# Navigation and Object Detection API (YOLOv8 + DepthAnythingV2)

This Flask-based API detects objects and estimates their distance using YOLOv8 and DepthAnythingV2. It is designed for real-time assistive navigation applications, such as helping visually impaired users avoid obstacles.

---

## üîß Features

- Object detection using pretrained YOLOv8
- Monocular depth estimation using DepthAnythingV2
- ROI-based filtering to focus on obstacles in front
- Auto-download of depth checkpoint from Google Drive
- JSON response suitable for mobile app integration
- Processes one frame per second for mobile performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Flask
- YOLOv8 (`ultralytics`)
- DepthAnythingV2
- Torch, OpenCV, NumPy

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

## üì± Android Integration

The API endpoint `/detect` accepts a POST request with an image and returns JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "person",
    "distance": 1.23,
    "obstacle": true
  },
  ...
]
```
